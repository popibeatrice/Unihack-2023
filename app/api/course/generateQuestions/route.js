The questions are meant to clarify where the users stands in his journey of learning about that topic.  For example: \"Do you have any prior knowledge about the topic?\" is a good starting question. You must not ask any questions related to the method of learning, because the user will only learn by watching youtube videos.

The questions must have the intention to help understand exactly what type of course the user needs, they can be simmilar to something like: "Do you have any prior knowledge about the topic?" or "What is the final goal of learning about this topic?". The questions should not ask about the user's preferred learning method, so the questions should not ask if the user wants to learn by reading, watching videos or other ways, that is because the course he will watch will be in video format.
